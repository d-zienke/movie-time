# Movie Time

## What is it?

Movie Time is a web app that may help you find interesting movies.

Everytime you open the app, it randomly picks a film and displays similar productions below.
You can also search by title or display a list of the newest, most popular or upcoming movies.

All the data comes from [**The Movie Database (TMDB) API**](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs)

## Will it be better?

Definitely! Once the main functionality is done, I plan to add searching by genre and extend the app to also suggest TV shows.

## Credits

- The app's layout and basic mechanism was inpired by the [_react-tv-show-adviser_](https://github.com/codiku/react-tv-show-adviser) by [**Robin Lebhar**](https://github.com/codiku), which is a project realized during his course on _Udemy_.

  - I redesigned this project using Figma and wrote all the code from scratch.
